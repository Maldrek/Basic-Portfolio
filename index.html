            <p>Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio in website form. I am excited to share with you everything that I have learned during the course of a six-month intensive in Web Development through the University of Kansas.<br><br>
            Here, you will find a collection of different projects that were completed during my time at KU. Hopefully this will give you insight into my abilities as a developer. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions!</p>
